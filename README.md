Project Description: Online Shopping Cart

Features:

Adding Items: Users can add items to the shopping cart. The items are represented as tasks in the application. Removing Items: Users can remove items from the shopping cart by clicking on the remove button associated with each item/task. Editing Items: Users can edit items in the shopping cart. Clicking on the edit button allows users to update the description of the item. Validation: Special characters and numbers are restricted in the task input field as well as the edit input field to ensure that only valid item descriptions are entered. Item Value: Each item added to the shopping cart has a fixed value of 2500 rupees. Calculating Total Bill: The application calculates the total bill by summing up the value of each item in the shopping cart. Reset Functionality: Users can reset the shopping cart, clearing all items and resetting the total bill to zero. Restrictions:

Special Characters and Numbers: Special characters and numbers are not allowed in the task input field as well as the edit input field. This ensures that only valid item descriptions are entered. Duplicate Items: Duplicate items cannot be added to the shopping cart. If a user attempts to add a duplicate item, they receive an alert indicating that the item already exists. Implementation:

The application uses JavaScript for dynamic functionality such as adding, removing, and editing items, as well as calculating the total bill and implementing validation. Local storage is utilized to store the tasks/shopping cart items, ensuring that the data persists even after page refresh. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with clear buttons for adding, removing, editing items, and resetting the shopping cart. Conclusion: The online shopping cart project provides a convenient way for users to manage their shopping lists, add and remove items, calculate the total bill, and ensure that only valid item descriptions are entered. With its intuitive interface and robust functionality, it offers a seamless shopping experience for users.
